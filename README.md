# Unity3D Examples
This repository is a collection of examples for Unity3D.

## Goal
- My primary goal is to provide myself examples for my work in Unity3D.
  I do this in all languages I've learned so far (ObjC and Swift being my primary languages for the past 13 years with some bits of C# for Xamarin - now moving on to C# in Unity3D) since implementing code myself teaches me way more than just copy/pasting examples found somewhere on the internet.
  This is the first example repository I also uploaded to Github: if it is of any help to someone else as well I am very happy about it.

## Important info about the content
- The examples are usually simplified without the usage of patterns, (unit) tests, null checks etc.
They are meant to only specifically show what's necessary in the example to make it as simple and short as possible.
Very good examples for patterns, testing and all other necessities in software development can be found on Github and Stackoverflow already. :-)
- Unity3D editor version used for the examples: `2020.1.5f1`

## Structure of the project
- You will find one folder per example in the `Asset` folder in the Unity editor. Within those folder you'll find the usual structure you might know from other projects: scenes, scripts, prefabs etc.

## Issues
- If you have any issues with the examples provided feel free to open an issue here in Github. Technical problems, questions, etc. are all welcome. Also suggestions for examples not yet included.

## Examples included so far
- Audio: play audio via an AudioSource
- Events: register and invoke a simple event
- EventWithParameters: use events with parameters
- MovingObjects: simple usage of Vector3 and Time.deltaTime
- UserInput\_Mouse: register mouse clicks on GameObject's

## Examples already planned for the future
- PlayerPrefs
- simple database using binary files
