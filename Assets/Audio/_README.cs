/**
 * Exmaple: Audio
 * 
 * Playing audio can be done in multiple ways. We use audio clips to play audio.
 * Those AudioClips can be played at a specific location (i.e. a vector) or played from an attached AudioSource.
 * 
 * The example consists of one GameObject:
 * - just an empty GameObject
 * 
 * Setting up the GameObject:
 * - add a script component: Audio.cs
 * - use the audio clip in the folder as the GameObjects's AudioClip
 * - add an AudioSource component, using the audio clip in the folder as its AudioClip
 * Everything else is done in code.
